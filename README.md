# EKS

In this repository I will be deploying an end-to-end production grade project on AWS EKS

I will deploy helm charts for cert-manager, external-dns, nginx ingress controller, prometheus, grafana

I will then automate everything with GithubActions and ArgoCD

I will also setup Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring my cluster

Security best practices will be enforced throughout from the beginning
